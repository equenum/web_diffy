# web_diffy

- What if the target page or node no longer exists?

# Todo:

- Import export resource / target configurations as json.
- Style user settings.
- Update tests for the snapshot services and change detector to account for Outcome and Message.
- Implement notifications.
- Add attribution section to readme including all libraries and licenses.
- Test diffs (especially added and removed lines).
- Highlight active, paused and change detected targets on the dashboard somehow.
- Set header subtitles for all pages.
