- Update tests for the snapshot services and change detector to account for Outcome and Message.
- Implement notifications.
- Add attribution section to readme including all libraries and licenses.
- Make all data grids outlined (also take a look if makes sense to outline other elements).
- Test diffs (especially added and removed lines).
- Add user setting to create targets as active by default. 
- Highlight active, paused and change detected targets on the dashboard somehow.
- Persist collapse panel state within a session.
